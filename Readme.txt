Windows Presentation Foundation Samples
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms771633.aspx

The Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) samples are divided into two categories: Application samples and Technology samples.
Application samples are end-to-end applications that demonstrate multiple platform features. These samples are intended to show real world usage scenarios, and are an effective way to see the breadth of WPF.
Technology samples are targeted to a specific technology area, such as Controls or Animation. These samples demonstrate specific usage scenarios or features, and are generally not end-to-end applications.
